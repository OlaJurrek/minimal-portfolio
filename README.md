## Minimal Portfolio

It is my first project which I am not (very) ashamed of showing to others. It is built in HTML5, CSS and pure Javascript. After a few months I have rewritten it a bit in a more semantic and accesible way. I have also organized CSS files according to SMACCS methodology then. This project really taught me what messy code means and why maintenance is important :fearful:
